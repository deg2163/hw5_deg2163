*Problem 1* This zip file contains data from a longitudinal study that included a control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other tidying that’s necessary Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

``` r
## Using functions and mapping to pull in data from different files

  list(read_csv(data) %>% 
  mutate(id = name))
}

path_names =

#Tidying the data
tidy_problem_1_df = 
problem_1_df %>% 
  gather(key = "week", value = "score", week_1:week_8) %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(str_extract(week, "\\d"))) %>% 
  separate(id, into = c("arm","id"), sep = "_") %>%

         arm = str_replace(arm, "con", "control"), 
         arm = str_replace(arm, "exp", "experimental")) 
```

Make a spaghetti plot: Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time, and comment on differences between groups.

``` r
tidy_problem_1_df %>% 
  ggplot()
```
